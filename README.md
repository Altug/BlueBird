# BlueBird
Custimizable Twitter feed fetcher. Javascript + CSS.

Based on @jasonmayes ' Twitter-Post-Fetcher I added - removed some parts to simplify the code to my needs as a value related editable user interface.

Keeping the code under development, feel free to use and develop with your own risk.


## Browser support

All popular browsers supported. Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera also Internet Explorer 7, 8, 9, 10, .. all that series of trash ...


## Notes

If you need IE8 support - ensure you do not set a non block level element as the target to render into. Use a DIV or similar instead. See http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/ms533897(v=vs.85).aspx This is due to browser, not Twitter Fetcher.
